Brief Description:
Enhance readability of reporting charts by providing additional data points as tooltips.

Long Description:
While most available tooltips only display static information, Dynamic Tooltip by MAQ Software displays both static text and dynamic data fetched from a data source. If the data from the data source changes, the tooltip will update automatically. Dynamic Tooltip by MAQ Software is also useful for adding visual aids and indication images, such as a glowing bulb icon in the corner of a chart that suggests to the audience that clicking the icon will yield “tips.”

Key features:
•	Static and dynamic tooltips for report charts.
•	Customized icon image configuration.
•	Formatting options for decimals and display unit data.
