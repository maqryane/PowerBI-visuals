Brief Description:
Display relationships between values in a ring chart with a dynamic key performance indicator (KPI) in the center.

Long Description:
Ring Chart by MAQ Software breaks large sums into smaller data slices. The size of each slice is relative to the data itself. The center of the ring displays a dynamic KPI and summary. Threshold values define the color and direction of the indicator.

For example, to display the contribution of various channels to the total sales, data for channels such as e-mail, store, and online can be represented as slices of the ring. In this scenario, the entire ring represents total sales.

Key features:
•	Provides 3D visual feedback when highlighting specific slices.
•	Displays raw data in legend, along with toggleable KPI indicators.
•	Showcases multiple data fields in tooltips.
